# Nth Child Task

This repository contains the implementation of the third task, where we utilized the `nth-child` selector in CSS to achieve specific styling effects. Additionally, we uploaded a screenshot showcasing the score for the game on the Flukeou website.

## Task Overview

In the third task, we focused on using the `nth-child` selector in CSS to create a zigzag pattern and to select specific colors for elements within a container.

## Implementation Details

### Zigzag Pattern

To create the zigzag pattern, we used the `nth-child` selector to target specific elements and apply styling to achieve the desired layout.

### Color Selection

I also utilized the `nth-child` selector to select elements based on their position within the container and applied different colors to them, enhancing visual appeal.

## Screenshot

I have uploaded a screenshot of the score for the game on the Flukeou website. You can find the screenshot in the repository.

Feel free to explore the code to see how the `nth-child` selector was utilized to accomplish the tasks and how the layout and styling were achieved.
